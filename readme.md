![Early Progress Gif](/gifs/progress1.gif)

- Website rework of the non-profit dog shelter near me
- Current Website to be reworked can be found [here](http://www.nataliessecondchance.org/)

- Technology used in this project include:
  - Django (python)
  - HTML5 / CSS3
  - Bootstrap
  - some Javascript / Jquery for customizing bootstrap
  
Current Progress:

 - Converted multipage layout to single page (for now)
 - Page is completely responsive
 - Created payment app integrating stripe checkout for donations
 - Started a pets app to add/remove their available dogs and display on their homepage/adoptions page dynamically
